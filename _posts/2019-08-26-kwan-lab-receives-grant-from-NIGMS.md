We just got word that we will receive a five year R35/MIRA award from [NIGMS](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/)! The title of the project is "Mining the cultured and uncultured biosphere for new drugs", and we will be working on ways to solve supply problems for natural products in uncultured systems as well as manipulating regulatory mechanisms in *Micromonospora* to turn on silent biosynthetic gene clusters. See the [Vacancies](/vacancies/index.html) page if you would like to work on this project!
